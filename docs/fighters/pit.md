# Pit

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED FIGHTER REFERENCE -->

[All fighters](../FIGHTERS.md) · [Controls](../CONTROLS.md)

Native fighter kind **30** (`pit`). This reference follows the compiled source;
it is not a device-calibration result. No fighter file loads during a match.

## Saved ledge responses

Open the menu with **R3**.
Up/Down selects a row; Left/Right cycles its
choices. Hold **L** to run the selected responses. Defaults are bold.

| Row | Saved choices, in menu order |
| --- | --- |
| Neutral | Nair; **Dtilt**; Ftilt; Utilt; Bow f-smash |
| Jump | **Nair**; Fair; Uair; Ground Utilt |
| Roll | **Dsmash**; Grab; Dtilt |
| Attack | **Shield Nair**; Grab/rear Nair; Shield Uair; Shield Fair |
| Drop | **Shield**; Dtilt > Shield; Near Nair; Near Fair; Near Dair; Low smash (spacing) |

These are the compact UI names; SH means short hop and Msl means missile.
Compact move labels match the menu without spacing hints. Capture returns control for manual
pummels/throws. Selecting a choice does not add a combo or change native hitboxes.

## Compiled move windows

These are stored inclusive animation-frame spans. They are not total input-to-hit
delays or proof that every phase of a multihit move stays active.

| Move | Stored frames |
| --- | --- |
| Neutral air | 4–5 |
| Down tilt | 6–7 |
| Forward tilt | 10–14 |
| Down smash | 5–6 |
| Down-smash rear window | 18–20 |
| Up Tilt | 6–8 |
| Forward Smash | 10–10 |
| Forward Air | 11–12 |
| Up Air | 10–12 |
| Down Air | 10–12 |

### Grab data

| Setting | Compiled value |
| --- | --- |
| Standing startup | 6 |
| Dash startup | 9 |
| Pivot startup | 10 |
| Shield-grab startup | 10 |
| Active duration | 2 |
| Standing reach reference (world units) | 13.0 |

Reach is an approximate root-based reference, not an animated grab/hurtbox model.
Shared roll grabs test predicted range/facing, height and vulnerability on the
same active frame. Native catch readiness and input delivery still matter.

## Baseline reference stats

Compiled [opponent/move reference](../OPPONENT_DATA.md); baseline facts, not
instance modifiers or a replacement for existing ledge tuning.

| Walk speed | 1.259 |
| Initial dash | 2.09 |
| Run speed | 1.828 |
| Air speed | 0.935 |
| Gravity | 0.081 |
| Fall speed | 1.48 |
| Fast fall | 2.368 |
| Short-hop height | 14.96 |
| Full-hop height | 31 |

## Execution and calibration

The profile declares adaptive short/full-hop selection for generic Jump coverage;
common Neutral and shield nairs remain short hops. A named handler can override
that policy, including grounded attacks and immediate short-hop recipes.

Spacing, resource requirements, opponent steering, stage geometry and online
input arrival still affect contact. There is no learned-delay compensation.
Use the [diagnostic result card](../CALIBRATION_CARD.md),
[execution/calibration](../FIGHTER_EXECUTION.md) and the
[roster exceptions](../NON_DLC_ROSTER.md#native-state-and-resource-exceptions)
before treating an option as reliable in a particular setup.

These are compiled choices; source changes need a separately authorized build/install.
